    "We have already seen in the module that the right application of regular expression can help in complex text manipulation by using fairly simple expressions. In this notebook we will explore some of that on a real-world dataset. This exercise will not only introduce some of the practical applications of regex to you, but will also make you comfortable with writing code for the same. Which will come handy in the **Social Media Information Extraction** project you will be doing in module 8.\n",
