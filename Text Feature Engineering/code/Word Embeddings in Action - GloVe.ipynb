    "\n",
    " - [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) have released their own algoritm for training word embedding like Word2Vec and it's called [Global Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) or GloVe for short.\n",
    " - Researchers at the moment prefer GloVe over Word2Vec based on results and in this notebook, you will learn how to utilize it on a text classification problem. \n",

    "### 2. Comparing GloVe vs Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are major differences between GloVe and Word2Vec models - \n",
    "\n",
    "- GloVe works similarly as Word2Vec. While Word2Vec is a **predictive model** that predicts context given a word (or vice-versa based on if you are using skip-gram or cbow variant),\n",
    "\n",
    "- GloVe learns by constructing a **co-occurrence matrix** (words x context) that basically counts how frequently a word appears in a context. Since it's going to be a gigantic matrix, we factorize this matrix to achieve a lower-dimension representation. There's a lot of details that goes in GloVe but that's the rough idea. \n",
    " \n",
    "- In word2vec, skip-gram models try to capture co-occurrence **one window at a time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Glove it tries to capture the counts of **overall statistics** how often it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the main difference is that GloVe embeddings work better on some data sets, while word2vec embeddings work better on others. They both do very well at capturing the semantics of analogy, and that takes us, it turns out, a very long way toward lexical semantics in general."

    "### 3. Utilizing Stanford NLP's pretrained GloVe\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to quickly start using GloVe in your problem statement, but before you can do that you need to install GloVe pre-trained embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Installing\n",
    "\n",
    " - Download the GloVe model from [Glove6B.zip](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip). This is the smallest model available which is trained on Wikipedia's text containing 6 Billion tokens and a vocabulary of around 400,000 words. The file is **822 MB** in size so it will take some time to download.\n",
    " - Extract the zip file by the following command\n",
    " \n",
    " `unzip glove.6B.zip`\n",
    " - Once you have extracted the file, you will see that there are multiple text files\n",
    "     1. **glove.6B.100d.txt** - Contains 100 dimension vectors for each word of the vocabulary.\n",
    "     2. **glove.6B.200d.txt** - Contains 200 dimension vectors for each word of the vocabulary.\n",
    "     3. **glove.6B.300d.txt** - Contains 300 dimension vectors for each word of the vocabulary.\n",
    "     4. **glove.6B.50d.txt**  - Contains 50 dimension vectors for each word of the vocabulary.\n",
    "     \n",
    " - Basicially based on your requirement, you can choose the dimensions of your vectors. In this case, you will work with the 300 dimensional one. \n",
